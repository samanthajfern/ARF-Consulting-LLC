    <p class="par1"><strong>Waluigi (Waruīji?)</strong> is a fictional character in the Mario franchise. He plays the role of Luigi's rival and nemesis and accompanies Wario in spin-offs from the main Mario series, often for the sake of causing mischief. He was created by Camelot employee Fumihide Aoki and is voiced by Charles Martinet, who described Waluigi as someone who has a lot of self-pity and would "cheat to win."</p>
    
    <p class="par2">Waluigi debuted in the game Mario Tennis as Luigi's rival and Wario's partner. Since then, he would remain a playable character in the main Mario series spin-offs, occasionally causing comedic mischief alongside Wario or antagonizing the rest of the characters, primarily Mario and Luigi. Since his debut, Waluigi has received mixed reception from fans and critics alike. 5* log
